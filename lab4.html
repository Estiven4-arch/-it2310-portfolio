        <p>This is the first paragraph.In this lab, I learned the basics of CSS styling and how it works with HTML to improve the appearance of a webpage. I created my first external CSS file and linked it to an HTML document using the <link> tag. I practiced using element selectors, class selectors, and pseudo-classes to target specific parts of a page. I also applied colors, fonts, padding, borders, and text alignment to change the layout and design. By the end of the lab, I was able to transform a plain HTML page into a more visually appealing and organized styled page.</p> 

       

  <p>This is the second paragraph. In this part of the lab, I worked with paragraph elements inside the <main> tag to organize text content on a webpage. I learned how the <p> tag is used to separate ideas into readable sections and how text inside paragraphs can be customized. This helped me understand how HTML structures content and how placeholder text can be used while building and styling a page.</p>
